In VRChat, there are two main things that affect how you use sign languages in VR: **controller type** and **dominant hand**. Your controllers dicate the kind of gestures you can perform, and how they are displayed in-game. Your dominant hand changes which hand you use for each part of a sign. There are only eight hand gestures in-game.

The following eight gestures look like those:

Before you start browsing the dictionary, please select your controller type below and get detailed instructions on how you can sign while in VRChat.

#### --Windows Mixed Reality--

Your controller type is **Windows Mixed Reality**, correct? This website will remember your selections until next reload.

Those are your gesture toggles:

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| <img src="/assets/images/idle_right.png" height="50" /><br><img src="/assets/images/wmr-noinput.png" height="50" /> | <img src="/assets/images/wmr-gesture-left.png" height="100" /> | <img src="/assets/images/wmr-gesture-right.png" height="100" /> | <img src="/assets/images/wmr-gripgesture-right.png" height="100" /> | <img src="/assets/images/wmr-triggergesture-right.png" height="100" /> |

You may see the following on some avatars:

| <img src="/assets/images/wmr-gesture-rocknroll.png" height="100" /> |
|-|
| <img src="/assets/images/rocknroll-var_right.png" height="100" /> |

In many sign languages, those often use **DOMINANT** and **SUPPORT** hands. For example, your dominant hand is your right and your support hand your left. Also, this website will use the right hand as dominant hand, if your dominant hand is your left, just assume the opposites of dominant and support hands. *Make sure you use correct hands for signing.*

On this website, we will determine the **DOMINANT (right)** hand as colored black hand and **SUPPORT (left)** hand as colored gray as shown visually:

| <img src="/assets/images/fist_left.png" height="100" /> | <img src="/VRSignLanguageDictionary/assets/images/fist_right.png" height="100" /> |
|-|-|
| <img src="/assets/images/openhand_left.png" height="100" /> | <img src="/VRSignLanguageDictionary/assets/images/openhand_right.png" height="100" /> |

Don't mistake the support hand as less important, it actually makes a huge difference in how you're signing. Remember those!

On this website, the **SUPPORT** hand will not be shown if it's not needed, as the **DOMINANT** hand often takes over.

#### --Vive Wands--

#### --Valve Index--

Your controller type is **Valve Index**, correct? This website will remember your selection until next reload.

Those controllers are revolved around accurate finger tracking unlike other controller types. Therefore, they are very good for sign language, since you have a far greater set of hand positions you can create with them. However, there are some downsides to this such as being unable to cross your fingers.

Before moving forward, ensure that **Gesture Mode** is turned off before signing with a conversation partner. You can press the left thumbstick to disable the **Gesture Mode**.
