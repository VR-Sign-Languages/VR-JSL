# Welcome to VR Sign Language Dictionary

This is an attempt to create the dictionary of VR American (VR-ASL) and VR Japanese Sign Language (VR-JSL). You can use this dictionary for references only.

A couple words of warning:

* Please don't serve this as an authority on sign languages. **Instead, if a trusted member of the Deaf / HoH community tells you otherwise, pay attention to them over what is documented here.**
* This dictionary is still a work in progress. A lot or some things will be changed in the future.

This dictionary is managed by a team of editors from Deaf / HoH community in VRChat. Anyone can contribute by using issues and pull requests fuctions on GitHub.

In VRChat, there are two main things that affect how you use sign languages in VR: **controller type** and **dominant hand**. Your controllers dicate the kind of gestures you can perform, and how they are displayed in-game. Your dominant hand changes which hand you use for each part of a sign. There are only eight hand gestures in-game.

The following eight gestures look like those:
